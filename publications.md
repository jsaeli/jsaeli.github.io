## Lidia Berdiaeva's Poetry

### "Flowers Invisible"
Flowers invisible,  
Inflammable,  
Flowers unfamiliar,  
Golden-vernal,  
Flowers ablaze,  
Lustrious,  
Lilac-perfumed  
Lily-white,  
Gardens of love,  
Gardens of suffering,  
Enclosure of secrecy  
And of silence.  
(before 1915)  

(Untitled)  
Цветы незримые,  
Неопалимые,  
Цветы нездешние,  
Золото-вешние,  
Цветы огнистые,  
Лучистые,  
Лилововейные,   
Лилейные.  
Сады любви,  
Сады страдания,  
Ограды тайны  
И молчания.  
<до 1915 г .>  

### "In suffering"
In suffering,  
In silence,  
There is a secret joy.  
It is invisible.  
As bright streams  
Flow under the earth,  
And snowdrops hide   
under a snowy shroud  
The deeper the wound--  
The brighter the joy,  
And joy conquers pain.  
It is with all those  
Who suffer.  
For Your sake, with You.  
(April 1945)  

(Untitled)  
В страдании,  
В молчании  
Есть радость тайная.  
Она незрима.  
Так светлые ручьи  
Струятся под землей,  
Подснежники под снежной  
пеленой таятся.  
Чем рана глубже —  
Радость ярче,  
И радость побеждает боль.  
Она со всеми,  
Кто страдает  
Ради Тебя, с Тобой.  
<Апр. 45>  

## A Small Room Full of Spiders

### Spiders
I am in a cramped cell, in this world.  
And cramped, low, is the cell.  
And in the four corners there are four  
Tireless spiders  

They are clever, greasy, and dirty.  
And always weaving, weaving, weaving...  
And terrifying is their monotonous,  
Uninteruppted labor.  

They weave the four cobwebs  
Into an enourmous one.  
I look -- their backs stir  
In the foul-gloomy dust.  

My eyes are under the cobweb.  
It is grey, soft, sticky.  
And joyful with an animal joy  
Are the four fat spiders.  

Пауки  
Я в тесной келье — в этом мире.  
И келья тесная низка.  
А в четырех углах — четыре  
Неутомимых паука.  

Они ловки, жирны и грязны.  
И всё плетут, плетут, плетут...    
И страшен их однообразный  
Непрерывающийся труд.  

Они четыре паутины  
В одну, огромную, сплели.  
Гляжу — шевелятся их спины  
В зловонно-сумрачной пыли.  

Мои глаза — под паутиной.  
Она сера, мягка, липка.  
И рады радостью звериной  
Четыре толстых паука.  
(1903)  

## A Small Room Full of Spiders

The world depicted in Zinaida Gippius’ poem “Spiders” (“Pauki”) is a small room ruled by web-spinning spiders, a realm trapped by history and fate. Gippius situates her three main symbols: the cell, the spiders, and the cobwebs, in a gloomy and claustrophobic environment which is constructed through carefully chosen words ; short sentences which evoke a cramped feeling; the four-line, four-verse poetic structure which mimics the four-cornered cell; and the lack of action taken by the listless narrator which reinforces a fatalistic view. These literary techniques set the stage in which the three main symbols act out the narrative of life according to Gippius: the physical world is a place ruled by fate and determined by the inevitable flow of time and history, which ultimately destroy the individual. The poem can also be interpreted to represent Gippius’ personal struggles with her gender and body as a female poet in turn-of-the-century Russia. The complete impression of the poem is powerful enough to affect the reader viscerally.

Gippius carefully sets the stage of her poem in the first stanza by presenting minimalist details in brief sentences, two of which end abruptly at the end of each of the first two lines. This creates a claustrophobic mood which is reinforced by the repetition of the adjective “tesnaia,” which seems to imply that not only is the cell “cramped,” but that the possibilities are so limited in this small word that other words are not available to describe it.1 The cell, Gippius explains, is “this world.” According to Gippius, the physical world is a realm wherein humans are limited by their physical, social, and historical circumstances and unable to enjoy the freedom for which their spirits yearn. 

The limitations imposed by physical reality include not only social limitations but also the limitations of one’s own physical body, especially the female body. In her book on the decadent imagination in turn-of-the-century Russia, Erotic Utopia, Olga Matich states that Gippius represented herself through a “male poetic persona and male pseudonyms.”2 She also often dressed as a male dandy, thereby “subvert[ing] the binary system of gender.”3  Through her masculine gender expression, Gippius rebelled against the social norms of turn-of-the-century Russia. However, her construction of a male poetic persona reveals an interior sexism, since it adheres to the prevalent contemporary idea that masculinity is intellectual and spiritual whereas women are defined primarily by their bodies. That is, to be a poet is masculine. Feeling that her spiritual and poetic inclinations were masculine, “Gippius had difficulty inhabiting her [female] body,” viewing it as an impediment to that which she desired: “transcendence, especially of the physical body.”4 Gippius was unable to overcome her internalized misogyny or affirm her female body, which became for her another “cramped cell” which trapped her physically, socially, and artistically. 

In addition to the symbol of the cell, Gippius uses the deftly described symbol of four spiders to craft a disturbing image of the rule of fate over this cramped world. The four spiders are an allusion to the Greek Fates, who “tirelessly” weave the tapestry of fate.5 The second stanza elaborates upon these spiders with chilling detail. Suddenly, the terse narrator, who previously had so few words that repetition was necessary, colorfully describes the spiders with three adjectives. The first word, “lovki,” seems positive, but designating it to an incredibly creepy creature as “dexterous” or “clever” only intensifies its threatening nature. “Zhirny,” which literally means “fat,” calls to mind a disgustingly greasy piece of meat. The juxtaposition of this image with the descriptor “dirty” creates the third, more revolting image of a greasy and muddy piece of meat—and there Gippius stops with another terse period. Although the Greek Fates are divine, Gippius depicts fate as something intimately related to the physical world, since fat and dirt are commonly associated with the earthly and contrasted against the spiritual or heavenly. The final stanza directly states what these spider-fates are: “animal.” This is not divine providence; this is the fatalism of the randomness and meaninglessness of history. The spiders weave monotonously and incessantly just as time and history plod on, catching all of humanity in its “adept,” inhuman claws and dragging them through the disgusting, greasy machinations of human history.

In this cramped world full of tyrannical spiders, cobwebs symbolize that which fate creates: earthly human history, which traps and dehumanizes individuals. The tapestry of history which the spiders weave is “dust[y]”, “foul” and “gloomy.” The four cobwebs, that is, the different histories of different places and peoples, may seem disconnected, but in the end they are all part of the same “gloomy,” inescapable tapestry. People of all nations are trapped in these “foul” webs of history and society and denied individuality. 

Gippius characterizes the anonymizing force of history by describing how these cobwebs cover the narrator’s eyes, which are the facial features commonly associated with individual personality. Here, the cobwebs are concisely described as “grey, soft, sticky.” The first two words, “grey” and “soft” are benign and even almost imply comfort, such as a calm, foggy evening or a soft couch. To be entrapped in this “dust[y]” world is not always uncomfortable; sometimes, it can be pleasurable and relaxing to lose oneself in the mindless everyday rhythm. But the last word pulls the reader out of this fantasy. The cobweb is “sticky,” thereby evoking a visceral reaction of disgust in the reader. Gippius was disgusted by this stickiness and evaded society’s gender norms, but she remained trapped by the difficulty of reconciling her female body with society’s historical definition of intellect as masculine; her individual personality was denied. The entrapping web woven by fate does not violently and externally bind us, but clings to us, violates our senses, and traps us by denying any boundary between the individual person and the faceless, inhuman mass of history.

The narrator, who is perhaps Gippius herself, performs her first action in the third stanza: she “look[s].” First, she merely co-existed in the cell with the spiders. Then, she felt terrified by their labor, which she passively sensed without looking. And when she finally acts, it is a receptive action, representing the powerlessness of the person trapped in this world. Even when we attempt to engage with our world, the most that we can do is passively and helplessly observe the world closing in around us. After being captured in cobwebs, the spiders reduce the narrator to absolute passivity and helplessness. Interestingly, Gippius does not describe her body entangled in webs: her eyes alone are described. This omission robs the narrator of a body, of the arms with which she could fight back and the legs with which she would run away. In this cell, she has been robbed of all ability to act and her eyes passively lie “under” the cobwebs.6 In the entire poem, the narrator’s only action is to look, and that ability is taken from her immediately in the next stanza, two lines later. It is not for humans, even those with poetic insight, to gaze upon the inner workings of fate and history, much less to fight against them.

When the narrator “look[s],” all that she sees are “[the spiders’] backs stirring \ in the foul-gloomy dust,” a description which calls to mind the skin-crawling experience of spotting, out of the corner of the eye, something slithering in the dark. Half-seen, the spiders are more terrifying than if they were fully revealed. The mysterious and distant hands of fate, crafting for us our inevitable futures, terrify us more and inspire in us more anxiety than any obvious and present threat which, by presenting itself, allows itself to be engaged with and, to an extent, controlled. Gippius can face down the society around her and assert herself against it through her unconventional lifestyle and writing, but cannot control the forces which operate within her own body. Matich records that Gippius wrote in Contes d'amour: “[I]f only I could let go ... of the voluptuous filth, which, I know, is hidden in me and which I don't even understand.”7 Gippius cannot “let go” or even “understand,” she can only “look” in helpless despair.8 “Spiders” depicts not only Gippius' discomfort with her female body but also her repulsion at her body’s natural sex drive: her existential frustration and confusion when faced with the uncontrollable forces of nature. She is trapped within the fate imposed upon her by the physical limitations and definition of her body.

Through stylistic repetition of the pattern of the first stanza in the beginning of the fourth stanza, Gippius conveys the continual, inevitable repetition of earthly history. The enjambment between the last two lines of the stanza teases a break from the short monotony of the first two short sentences, but, by jarring the reader across the line break, destabilizes the reader: even when the monotony of history breaks, it does so with a disconcerting jolt. 

Gippius further mimics the first stanza with the repetition of “four ... spiders,” although with an importantly different adjective.9 While before the spiders were “zhirny” (fat, greasy), now, the spiders are “tolst[y]: “fat, large.” Gippius recalls the previous image but uses a slightly different meaning of fat: fat from having eaten heartily. What have the spiders consumed to become fat? It can only be the flesh of the entrapped narrator, who has been consumed by and assimilated into the endless flow of time. Earthly, heavy fate, the absolute ruler of the physical world, traps the human spirit within a limited body, society, and history and ultimately destroys the individual. The poem begins with “I” but ends with “spiders:” with fate.

The literary techniques  and symbols which Gippius utilizes in “Spiders” reinforce each other and subtly magnify the gloomy and fatalistic atmosphere of the poem while also invoking visceral reactions in the reader. Layers of meaning are created by the narrative, the words chosen, the sentence structure, the structure of the poem itself, the imagery, the symbolism, and the poet's own life. The final result is a subtle multiplication of unease and despair which creates continual low-level anxiety in the reader, despite the apparent straight-forward simplicity of the poem. In Dostoevsky’s novel Crime and Punishment, the villainous character Svidrigailov famously describes the afterlife as “one small room… dingy, with spiders in all the corners.”10  But Gippius has a more radical claim. That small room full of spiders isn’t Hell, after all; it’s this world.
