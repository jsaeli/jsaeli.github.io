## Welcome to Jessie Saeli's Page

Hello there! I am a graduate student at Boston College in the Philosophy Department.

### About Me:

I am a student in the M.A. program in philosophy at Boston College. I began my graduate studies after graduating _magna cum laude_ from the University of Notre Dame, where I studied philosophy and Russian. I also work as a [graduate assistant](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/sites/global-engagement/about.html) for the Office of Global Engagement and as a [Religon & Media Fellow](https://mindandculture.org/about/people/interns/) at the Center for Mind and Culture.

My academic interests are intersubjectivity, personhood, and Russian philosophy. My central question is: What is a “self”? I approach this question primarily with the concepts of intersubjectivity and relationality. Most recently, I am exploring Buddhist interpretations of "no-self". In Russian studies, I focus on literature and poetry from the Russian Golden and Silver Ages, as well as patriotic education in Soviet and contemporary Russia. I am working on a translation of Nikolai Berdiaev's final work and autobiography _Self-Knowledge_ (_Самопознание_).

As a graduate assistant for the Office of Global Engagement, I organize programming for international students and faculty, including designing promotional materials and coordinating with speakers. I design Globle Engagement's bi-monthly newsletter, [The Bridge](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/sites/global-engagement/about/thebridge.html) and work on editing and revising manuscripts for lectures and publication.

As Religion & Media fellow for the Center for Mind and Culture, I write [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@saelij) related to their projects, manage the Modeling Religious Change [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ReligiousChange) account, and identify relevant media contacts, grants, and calls for papers.

I am currently reading Richard Kearney's _The Wake of Imagination_.

### Areas of interest:
- Intersubjectivity and personhood (Merleau-Ponty, Arendt)
- Russian philosophy (Solovyov, Berdiaev)
- Existentialism (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche)
- Russian Literature (Dostoevsky, Pushkin, Gippius)
