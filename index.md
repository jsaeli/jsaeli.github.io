## Welcome to Jessie Saeli's Page

Hello there! I am a graduate student at Boston College in the Philosophy Department.

### About Me:

I am a student in the M.A. program in philosophy at Boston College. I began my graduate studies after graduating _magna cum laude_ from the University of Notre Dame, where I studied philosophy and Russian. My primary interests are intersubjectivity, personhood, and Russian philosophy. My central question is: What is a “self”? I approach the question of the self from the Russian Orthodox idea, elaborated by Vladimir Solovyov, that personhood is essentially relational. Beyond the Russian context, I study the self and intersubjectivity, exploring how relationality and sociability are essential to personhood. My goal is to develop an understanding of the self/personhood which doesn't prioritize traditionally masculine traits, such as independence, rationality, and the mind but also celebrates traditionally feminine traits such as relationality, emotionality, and the body. In Russian studies, I focus on literature and poetry from the Russian Golden and Silver Ages, as well as patriotic education in Soviet and contemporary Russia. I enjoy reading and writing about philosophy, theology, and literature. 

### Areas of interest:
- Intersubjectivity and personhood (Merleau-Ponty, Arendt)
- Russian philosophy (Solovyov, Berdiaev)
- Existentialism (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche)
- Russian Literature (Dostoevsky, Pushkin, Gippius)
